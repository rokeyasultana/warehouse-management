            <p class="mb-5 text-secondary">There are different categories in perfumery for different perfume types. When shopping for perfume you have probably come across terms like Parfum, Eau de Parfum, Eau de Toilette, and Eau de Cologne. These terms actually refer to concentration which describes the amount of pure perfume oil within a fragrance. Generally, the higher the perfume concentration, the higher the longevity on the skin and also the higher the price point.</p>

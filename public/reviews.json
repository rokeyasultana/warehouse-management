   "reviewer": " like more citrusy and spicy notes in my fragrances as compared to the floral ones. Although I‚Äôd say that Gucci guilty is an exception. It‚Äôs a very crisp perfume. I wouldn‚Äôt call it sexy but it‚Äôs very sophisticated mature kind of a perfume. It is more of an evening perfume , when you want to smell sort of ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù or polished.  It‚Äôs not every girly or feminine. I‚Äôd say the perfume sort of exudes that message of strength and power.",

If you are looking for something similar to the original white diamonds this isn‚Äôt it. It is a completely different scent. I can‚Äôt distinguish any particular notes but all I do know is that it‚Äôs sweet and lasting , maybe a bit powdery.",

      "review": "  I've tried to like this one, as a lover of all things citrusy, but Pomelo Fizz is just not for me. It opens briskly, with a bracing citrus note that lacks any sweetness (or joy‚Äînot a good start), then morphs very quickly into a synthetic woody, musky base. I do not particularly care for the mix of woods and musks in this, and would have much preferred something a little more floral. Pomelo Fizz is very unisex, but also very emotionless and boring. Thank goodness I only bought a travel spray. ",
